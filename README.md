### Reflection 
This assignment taught me the basics of Arduino and helped me understand how to power an LED with the Arduino circuit board.


## variable LED blinker


### description
I learned how to make an LED light blink in intervals while continuously getting faster and faster.
### proof

### Reflection 
This taught me how to do basic Arduino coding to set different intervals between each press.

## Button Activated LED

### description
I learned how to activate a LED with a push of a button
### proof

### reflection 
This assignment showed me how to hook a button to my Arduino which is usefull for many types of circuits.

## 2 Button Activated LED

### description
This assighnment had me using two buttons instead of one to activate 2 LEDs.
### proof

### reflection 
This assignment was very similar to the button activated LED exept we had to use 2 buttons instead of one; this brought a lot off challange to the assignment and was really fun to make.

## Servo Control

### description
I made a circuit that made my servo move with 2 buttons.
### proof
